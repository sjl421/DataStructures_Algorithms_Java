//  #277. Find the Celebrity
//  Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1) and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The
//  definition of a celebrity is that all the other n - 1 people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.
//
//  Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do
//    is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information of whether A knows B. You need to find out the
//  celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).
//
//  You are given a helper function bool knows(a, b) which tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function
//  int findCelebrity(n), your function should minimize the number of calls to knows.
//
//  Note: There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's label if there is a
//  celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.

      if(knows(celb, i)) celb  = i;

    // In second pass for every person who is not candidate
    // We find if he knows our cancdidate, if not then our candidate is not celebrity
    // Or if our candidate knows the current person, in this case also our candidate cannot be celebrity
    // Thus as per problem there can be only one celeberity, if its not we return -1 else the candidata
